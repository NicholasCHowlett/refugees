# RefugeesOnNauru
## Summary
Web application that displays particular words taken from relevant news articles, related to refugees detained on Nauru, found on the Guardian website. The particular words selected will either be direct quotes, or sentences related to a keyword, or common words from within articles. #KidsOffNauru

## Motivation
This project will attempt to inform readers about the current issues surrounding refugees (and hopefully asylum seekers) held in detention on Nauru (and hopefully elsewhere). By selecting particular words, I hope to engage readers (application users) on a deeper and more humane level than by them being exposed to only headlines, leading them to explore the issue with a differing mindset. In other words, I wish to demonstrate that hard, precise computation (code) can affect living, breathing people (readers).

## Development roadmap
Multiple prototypes will be designed/developed [1], with each having a particular word type focus, after which user testing will determine which prototype to focus continued effort upon toward hopefully becoming a Minimum Viable Product [2].

### Prototypes
The multiple prototypes generated will include:
1. A prototype that displays sentences (Prototype 1). These sentences will be either direct quotes (Prototype 1A) or sentences related to a keyword (Prototype 1B).
2. A prototype that displays common words (Prototype 2). These common words will be the most popular words (excluding common types such as articles).

### Prototypes' user testing
Once Prototype 1 has been developed, input from a small group of people (representative of actual users) will be gathered via A/B testing of it's sub-prototypes, where the differing focus of the sentences are compared.

Once Prototype 2 has been developed, this prototype will be compared against the better of Prototype 1 via user testing, then the better of Prototype 1 versus 2 will be developed further (no synthesis of prototypes will occur).

During user testing, better will be gauged using primarily quantitative methods initially, with intention to use qualitative methods later [3]. Insight generated from user testing will guide the selection & evolution of the chosen prototype.

## Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing. I would like to involve developers & people affiliated with refugees & asylum seekers.

If you would like to develop code for this project please contact me before pulling the repository so we can work out a plan of attack. I wish to achieve the functionality outlined in the summary. For development plan of prototypes please refer to application code (main.py).

If you are or know anyone with links to refugees (for example you work in the refugee field) and would like to contribute please also contact me. I intend to collaborate with certain people [4] on this project, if it seems right.
