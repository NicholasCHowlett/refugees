# RefugeesOnNauru
## Project summary
Single web page that displays numerous quotes taken from particular news articles, related to refugees detained on Nauru, found on the Guardian website. #KidsOffNauru

## Motivation for project
This project will attempt to inform readers about the current issues surrounding refugees (and hopefully asylum seekers) held in detention on Nauru (and hopefully elsewhere). By extracting and combining particular quotes, I hope to engage readers (application users) on a deeper and more humane level than by them being exposed to only headlines.

## Project development roadmap
This prototype application is currently being developed to become a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) [1]. As such, I am currently focused solely on developing only the functionality described in the project summary. Next, collaboration will be sought most likely from non-profit organisations that work in the refugee field in addition to any person of a refugee background. Later, input from a separate group of people will be gathered during user testing of the application.

## Contributing guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing. If you consider yourself a developer and would like to develop code for this project please contact me before pulling the repository so we can work out a plan of attack. If you are or know anyone with links to refugees (e.g. you work in the refugee field) and would like to controbute please also contact me. I hope to have both 'groups' of people involved.

## Technical details
Application developed in Python. For code design/development plan please refer to TODO's within application (main.py). Code currently: 
1. Retrieves news articles related to refugees detained on Nauru, from the Guardian website.
2. Compiles sentences, that are directly relevant, from all retrieved news articles, into a 2-dimensional list.
3. Removes extraneous characters/symbols surrounding each sentence (cleans data).
