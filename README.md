# RefugeesOnNauru
## Project summary
Single web page that displays numerous sentences taken from particular news articles, related to refugees detained on Nauru, found on the Guardian website. #KidsOffNauru

## Project development summary
This application prototype is currently being developed to become a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). As such, development is solely focused on achieving the project summary. Once achieved, input will be sought most likely from non-profit organisations that work in the refugee space, & also a separate group of people will be involved for user testing.

## Getting involved
If you are a developer and would like to contribute to this project please contact me before pulling code so we can work out a plan of attack. Project configuration file (Vagrantfile) is available if needed. If you are or know anyone with links to refugees (especially on Nauru) please also contact me. I need help from both 'types' of people.

## Technical details
Application developed in Python. For code design/development plan please refer to TODO's within application (main.py). Code currently: 
1. Retrieves news articles related to refugees detained on Nauru, from the Guardian website.
2. Compiles sentences, that are directly relevant, from all retrieved news articles, into a 2-dimensional list.
3. Removes extraneous characters/symbols surrounding each sentence (cleans data).
